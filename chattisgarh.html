Pandwani means Pandavwani – that is Panda Katha, a story of Mahabharata. Pandwani is a folk ballad form performed predominantly in Chhattisgarh. It depicts the story of the Pandavas, the leading characters in the epic Mahabharata. It is narrated in a very lively form, almost constructing the scenes in the minds of the audience.Traditionally a male preserve, it has seen the inclusion of women artist in recent times.The artists in the Pandwani narration consist of a lead artist and some supporting singers and musicians. The lead artist narrates one episode after another from the epic in a very forceful manner. He enacts the characters in the scenes to produce a more realistic effect. Occasionally, he also breaks out into a dance movement. During the performance he sings along the rhythm produced by the ektara held in his hand. There are two styles of narration in Pandwani; Vedamati and Kapalik. In the Vedamati style the lead artist narrates in a simple manner by sitting on the floor throughout the performance. The Kaplik style is livelier, where the narrator actually enacts the scenes and characters.</p></h3>

They also carry “Mridanga” and waves themselves in parade. The prime dancer starts with the initiation of song and then the other dancers repeat the dance in a step wise manner. The start of the song, music and dance is slow. But as the song progresses the dance also progresses in its pace, with increasing rhythem of Mridanga. The gestures of the step are variable with the song with group members forming human pyramid and other such complex structures in between. Mean while the rhythem of the song is maintained and magic of panthi dance continues. Main dancer of the group motivates others by chanting of Aaha, Aaha ….. loudly.
