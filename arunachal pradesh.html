    <h1 style="color:#3355FF;padding:20px;align:center;">'..Buiya Dance..'</h1>
	    <p align="center"><img src="https://www.iasgyan.in//ig-uploads/images//3927582589_49c5897ebd_b.jpg" alt="gujrat" width="500" height="500"></p>
	   <h3><p>The tribe to which Buiya folk dance belongs is known as the Digaru Mishmis. The Digaru Mishmi women and men perform the dance. Often performed after a grand feast or in some family gathering, the Buiya dance is a joyful dance that binds the people together. Buiya dance is also performed in multiple festivals like Tazampu, Duiya, and, Tanuya.</p></h3>
<h3><p>As the music plays and the gong beats, buiya dancers start moving from the front end of the passage to the rear. The movements are effortless, with the right foot put forward to move ahead by one step. Then the left leg is supported on the left heel with the knee slightly bent. These movements are repeated till the end of the passage is reached.

 

Another movement involves skipping a step. This is slightly difficult and is usually seen during the performances at festivals. The women make small graceful jumps to move forward. The men, on the other hand, perform higher jumps, which are much faster as compared to the movements of the women.

<h1 style="color:#FF3377;padding:20px;align:center;">'..Chalo Dance..'</h1>
	    <p align="center"><img src="https://www.iasgyan.in//ig-uploads/images//chalo.jpg" alt="gujrat"width="500" height="500"></p>
	   <h3><p>The Chalo dance is part of Arunachal Pradesh’s most awaited festival, called Chalo Loku. This festival is a grand celebration in the state and takes place every year in October and November.

</p></h3>
<h3><p>It is a celebration of the Nocte tribe. The name “Chalo Loku” translates to paddy cultivation season in English. It is celebrated just before the farmers harvest the paddy. This festival is a way by which the Nocte tribe says goodbye to a past season.

 

The Chalo dance is open to people of all ages. The performance at the chief’s courtyard requires dancers to be dressed traditionally. The men wear a loincloth in the Indian dhoti style on the bottom. The top is usually bare or adorned with silver or bamboo jewellery.

 

The headgear is an elaborate one with white feathers attached and many other decorative pieces. The women wear a blouse and cotton skirt that goes up to their knees. They also tie a matching piece of cloth on the waist. Both men and women wear metallic rings, armlets, anklets and earpieces.

<h1 style="color:#047E55;padding:20px;align:center;">'..Wancho Dance..'</h1>
<p align="center"><img src="https://www.iasgyan.in//ig-uploads/images//wancho-dance.jpg" alt="gujrat" width="500" height="500"></p>
	   <h3><p>Wancho tribe’s most important festival is known as Oriah. The celebrations take place in the spring months of March and April. The festival begins with prayers, and then music and dance are organised for entertaining the villagers. The Wancho dance is performed at this festival. The dance brings together all members of the tribe which creates a feeling of solidarity.

 </p></h3>
<h3><p>Both men and women engage in the dance. They usually take turns to perform, accompanied by songs sung by them. The men carry swords on their right hand, which they wield during the dance. The performance begins with the men singing and dancing. They also make a peculiar thrusting movement with the sword, which is unique. Once the men end their song and dance, the women come in and start a song. They match steps to the song and the song is a reply to what the men conveyed through their song. This process is repeated for various times.

 

The men make a round configuration and move around doing the dance moves. The women on the other hand form two straight lines, facing each other.
